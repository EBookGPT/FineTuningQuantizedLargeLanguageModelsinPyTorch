# 5. Steps for fine-tuning Large Language Models

Welcome back, dear readers! In the last chapter, we delved into the world of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and understood what it is all about. In this chapter, we will look at the steps we need to follow to fine-tune LLMs. 

And who better than Jeremy Howard, the co-founder of fast.ai and renowned deep learning practitioner, to guide us along the way? Jeremy has been instrumental in advancing the field of NLP and has been recognized for his contributions with numerous awards and recognitions. 

So, without further ado, let's get started on our journey towards fine-tuning LLMs with Jeremy Howard's guidance! We will discuss the five steps that are critical to achieving the best results when fine-tuning LLMs. 

But before we begin, let us make sure that we have the prerequisites in place. We will be using PyTorch for our code examples, and it is essential that readers have a solid understanding of PyTorch concepts. For those who are new to PyTorch, we recommend the tutorials on the official PyTorch website as a good starting point. 

Now, let's get started with the first step of fine-tuning LLMs - Data Gathering!
# 5. Steps for fine-tuning Large Language Models

It was a dreary afternoon in London, and I, Sherlock Holmes, was seated in my armchair, lost in thought. Suddenly, the door to my apartment burst open, and in walked Jeremy Howard, the co-founder of fast.ai. He looked distraught, and his eyes betrayed a sense of urgency.

"Mr. Holmes," he said, "I need your help. I have been working on a project to fine-tune LLMs, but I seem to have hit a roadblock."

"Pray, do tell me more, Mr. Howard," I replied.

"I have followed all the steps to fine-tune LLMs, but my results are far from satisfactory. I cannot seem to improve the performance of my LLM, no matter what I do," Jeremy explained.

"I see," I said, stroking my chin. "Pray, tell me what steps you have followed."

Jeremy then proceeded to explain to me the five steps to follow for fine-tuning LLMs that he had learned from my book. He had followed these steps carefully, but he could not seem to get the results he desired. 

"This is intriguing," I said. "Let me have a closer look at your code, Mr. Howard."

I examined Jeremy's code carefully and found that he had missed out on a crucial detail during data gathering. I realized that he had not included enough data from the target domain, which was causing the LLM to underperform.

"Aha!" I exclaimed. "I have found the problem, Mr. Howard. You have not included enough data from the target domain during data gathering."

Jeremy looked surprised. "But I followed all the steps carefully. How could I have missed such a critical detail?"

"Sometimes, even the most meticulous of us can overlook important details," I said, with a wry smile.

I recommended that Jeremy go back and revise his data gathering process, ensuring that he included enough data from the target domain. He followed my advice, and his LLM's performance improved substantially.

"Thank you, Mr. Holmes," said Jeremy, clearly relieved. "I am grateful for your help."

"It is my pleasure, Mr. Howard," I replied. "Remember, when it comes to fine-tuning LLMs, every detail matters." 

And with that, I bid Jeremy farewell, satisfied with another case solved.
The code used to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery involved examining Jeremy Howard's data gathering process to identify the issue. Specifically, we discovered that Jeremy had not included enough data from the target domain during data gathering, which was causing the LLM to underperform.

To resolve this issue, we recommended that Jeremy revise his data gathering process and include more data from the target domain. This is a critical step in the fine-tuning process that ensures the LLM can learn from the specific language used in the target domain, improving its performance.

Here is an example of what the data gathering code might look like:

``` python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.data = [] 
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            for line in f:
                self.data.append(line)
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]
        

# Load the pre-training data
train_dataset = CustomDataset('pretraining_data.txt')

# Load the target-domain data
target_dataset = CustomDataset('target_domain_data.txt')

# Combine the two datasets for fine-tuning
full_dataset = ConcatDataset([train_dataset, target_dataset])

# We can then use the full_dataset to fine-tune our LLM
```

In this code, we first define a custom dataset that loads the data from a given path. We then create two instances of this dataset, one for the pre-training data and one for the target-domain data. We combine these two datasets using the `ConcatDataset` function and use the resulting dataset to fine-tune our LLM.

By including enough data from the target domain during data gathering, we can ensure that our LLM can learn from and adapt to the specific language used in that domain, leading to improved performance.
