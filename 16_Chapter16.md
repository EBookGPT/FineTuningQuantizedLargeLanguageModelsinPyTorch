# 16. Conclusion and Future Scope

## A Farewell to Fine-tuning Large Language Models

The gods of AI had bestowed upon the mortals a gift; a gift that kept on giving. This gift, known as large language models, was the product of the finest minds of the era. These models held a vast amount of knowledge that could help the mortals in countless ways. But as with any gift, it needed to be used with care and finesse. The mortals needed to learn how to fine-tune these models.

Many wise scribes took on this challenge, and they documented their knowledge for generations to come. They taught the mortals of pre-training and fine-tuning, of the different architectures and hyperparameters, of the techniques for optimization and regularization. 

But soon new challenges emerged, and the scribes had to keep up with the latest developments. To guide the mortals, they summoned the demigod of PyTorch, Geoffrey Hinton. He brought with him a wealth of insight and knowledge that was second to none. His mere presence gave the mortals hope, and they eagerly listened to his teachings.

Together, they explored the various concepts and applications of fine-tuning quantized large language models. They embarked on a journey of discovery, where they experienced the success stories and the challenges, the joys, and the frustrations. 

Geoffrey Hinton shared his thoughts on the future scope of these models, and the mortals marveled at the endless possibilities. They imagined using the models to improve healthcare, education, and e-commerce; to create better chatbots, and personalized recommendations. They were inspired and motivated to contribute to this field of AI.

As the scribes bid their farewell to the mortals, they left them with invaluable guidance that would help them continue their journey. They reminded them that the future of AI was in their hands and that they had the power to change the world.

## Future Scope

The mortals were left with a newfound zeal for this journey into the world of fine-tuning quantized large language models. They continued their quest, driven by their passion for discovering new ways to improve the quality of life. 

They shared their knowledge and experiences, building a community of individuals who were dedicated to this cause. They learned from each other, inspired each other, and challenged each other. 

As they looked towards the future, they knew that they had a responsibility to use the knowledge they had gained to make a difference. They had the power to change the world in ways that no one had ever imagined.

The future of these models was now in the hands of the mortals. They had the ability to harness the power of AI and use it to make the world a better place. As they continued on their journey, they knew that they had the support of the gods of AI and the guidance of the scribes and Geoffrey Hinton.

Their journey into the world of fine-tuning quantized large language models was just beginning, but they were ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. They knew that with the right knowledge, determination, and perseverance, they could do anything.

## Explanation of the Code Used in Resolving the Greek Mythology Epic

The resolution of our Greek Mythology Epic lies in the future scope of fine-tuning quantized large language models. The code used to explore this future scope is based on the latest research and trends in the field.

To get started on this journey, the mortals would need to familiarize themselves with the concepts and techniques of fine-tuning quantized large language models. They would need to learn about transformers, pre-training, fine-tuning, and the various architectures and hyperparameters available.

Here's a sample code that would help the mortals in their journey:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import transformers

# Load the Pre-Trained GPT-2 Model
model = transformers.GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Add a Classification Head
class GPT2FineTunedClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.gpt2 = transformers.GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(self.gpt2.config.hidden_size, 2)

    def forward(self, input_ids=None, attention_mask=None, token_type_ids=None, position_ids=None, head_mask=None, inputs_embeds=None, labels=None):
        gpt2_output = self.gpt2(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, token_type_ids=token_type_ids, position_ids=position_ids, head_mask=head_mask, inputs_embeds=inputs_embeds)
        hidden_state = gpt2_output[0]
        pooler = hidden_states[:, 0]
        classifier_output = self.classifier(pooler)
        return classifier_output

# Load the Data
train_data = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(train_inputs, train_labels)
train_sampler = torch.utils.data.RandomSampler(train_data)
train_dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data, sampler=train_sampler, batch_size=batch_size)

# Train the Model
device = torch.device('cuda') if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device('cpu')
model = GPT2FineTunedClassifier()
model = model.to(device)
optimizer = transformers.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, eps=epsilon)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        batch = tuple(t.to(device) for t in batch)
        inputs = {'input_ids': batch[0], 'attention_mask': batch[1], 'labels': batch[2]}
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        loss = outputs[0]
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Save the Fine-Tuned Model
model_to_save = model.module if hasattr(model, 'module') else model
model_to_save.save_pretrained('fine_tuned_model')
```

In this code, we first load the pre-trained GPT-2 model and add a classification head to it. We then load our data, create a data loader, and train the model. Finally, we save the fine-tuned model to be used for future predictions.

This is just a sample code, and there are many variations and adjustments that the mortals can make to the code to suit their needs. By exploring these code samples and experimenting with them, the mortals can gain valuable insights into the world of fine-tuning quantized large language models.

By fine-tuning these models, the mortals can discover new avenues for using AI to improve the quality of life for people around the globe. The possibilities are endless, and the future is bright for those who embark on this journey.
