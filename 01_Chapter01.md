# Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to the wonderful world of Fine Tuning Quantized Large Language Models in PyTorch! As we delve deeper into the digital age, machine learning and natural language processing have become an integral part of our everyday lives. Companies extensively use state-of-the-art language models, such as BERT and GPT-2, to perform a variety of tasks - from building virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to summarize large documents for users.

However, training these models can be computationally expensive, and each new task requires retraining these large models from scratch, which can be time-consuming. To make the training process faster and more efficient, Fine Tuning techniques have been introduced in recent years. 

PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library, has gained significant popularity among researchers and developers for training these models due to its flexibility and ease of use. Moreover, PyTorch provides tools to quantize pre-trained models, reducing the memory footprint and increasing model inference speed. 

In this chapter, we will go over the basics of fine-tuning, quantization and their benefits for large language models. We will explore PyTorch tools to facilitate these processes and prepare us for the exciting journey of building state-of-the-art language models. So, buckle up, grab your swords, and let's embark on a quest to explore Fine Tuning Quantized Large Language Models in PyTorch.
# Chapter 1: Introduction

Once upon a time, in the land of PyTorch, King Arthur and his knights of the round table set out on a quest to build state-of-the-art language models for their kingdom. However, there was a problem - building and training these models required extensive resources, slowing down their quests.

One day, as Arthur and his knights were discussing their plans, Merlin, the wise wizard, appeared before them. Merlin told them of the magical powers of Fine Tuning and Quantization, which would help them build faster, more efficient models.

Arthur and his knights, eager to learn more, ventured forth to the PyTorch Castle to learn more about these concepts. They reached the castle and were received by the Master of PyTorch. The Master taught them about the basics of Fine Tuning and Quantization, how it could help reduce computation time by leveraging pre-trained models and optimizing memory utilization while increasing the speed of model inference.

Amazed by the power of Fine Tuning and Quantization, Arthur and his knights returned to their kingdom, eager to put these concepts into practice. They spent countless hours training their models, implementing Fine Tuning to improve performance and Quantization to reduce model size.

With the help of Fine Tuning and Quantization, Arthur and his knights were able to build larger models faster, reducing the time for their quests, and keeping their kingdom at peace. They had learned a valuable lesson and were excited to continue their journey to build more and better models.

And so, the journey of King Arthur and his knights to learn and implement Fine Tuning Quantized Large Language Models in PyTorch, began!

Stay tuned for the next chapter, where we will explore the implementation of fine-tuning in PyTorch, and step into the shoes of Arthur and his knights.
In the story, King Arthur and his knights learned about Fine Tuning and Quantization to improve the efficiency of building language models. In this section, we will explore the code used to fine-tune pre-trained models and quantize them in PyTorch.

## Fine Tuning

Fine Tuning refers to the process of applying additional training to a pre-trained model to adapt it to new tasks. It is often used to improve the accuracy of a model in a specific domain. PyTorch provides tools to facilitate fine-tuning of models, and we will explore some of them below.

One such tool is the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class that PyTorch provides to make it easier to load and process data. Here is an example of how it can be used to create a custom dataset:

```python
import torch.utils.data as data

class CustomDataset(data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
        
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.data[index]
```

In this example, we create a custom dataset called `CustomDataset` that takes in a list of data and implements the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods. The `__len__` method returns the length of the dataset, and the `__getitem__` method returns a single item from the dataset at the given index.

Once we have defined our dataset, we can use PyTorch's `DataLoader` class to load the data in batches and pass it to the model for fine-tuning:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

dataset = CustomDataset(data)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

for data_batch in dataloader:
    # Pass the batch of data to the model for fine-tuning
```

In this example, we first create an instance of our `CustomDataset` class with our data and then use the `DataLoader` class to load the dataset in batches with a defined batch size. We can then pass each batch of data to the model for fine-tuning.

## Quantization

PyTorch provides tools to quantize pre-trained models, reducing memory footprint and increasing the speed of model inference. One such tool is the `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic` function, which can be used to quantize pre-trained models dynamically.

Here's an example of how we can use the `quantize_dynamic` function to quantize a pre-trained model:

```python
import torch.quantization

# Load the pre-trained model
model = torch.load('pre_trained_model.pth')

# Prepare the model for quantization
model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
torch.quantization.prepare(model, inplace=True)

# Fine-tune the quantized model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Training the model
    pass

# Convert the model to a quantized one
torch.quantization.convert(model, inplace=True)
```

In this example, we first load the pre-trained model and then set the `qconfig` property to a default quantization configuration. We then apply the `prepare` function to prepare the model for quantization.

Next, we fine-tune the model using any standard fine-tuning technique. Finally, we use the `convert` function to convert the model to a quantized one, in place, with the option to specify the type of quantization (e.g., `fbgemm`).

With these tools in hand, King Arthur and his knights successfully fine-tuned and quantized their models, making them faster, more efficient, and better suited for their quests.
