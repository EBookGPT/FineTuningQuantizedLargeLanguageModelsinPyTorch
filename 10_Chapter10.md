# Chapter 10: Inference of Large Language Models

Welcome back, dear reader, to our journey into Fine Tuning Quantized Large Language Models in PyTorch! If you've made it this far, it means you are well-equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively fine-tune your language models. However, training your model is only half the battle. 

Once your model has been fine-tuned and saved, you will eventually need to use it to perform inference on new inputs, be it generating text, classifying sentiment or any other natural language processing task that fits your requirements. In this chapter, we will explore how to leverage PyTorch to effectively perform inference on your fine-tuned model.

We will start off by taking a look at the various deployment settings available to you, ranging from deploying your model on a production server to deploying it on devices such as mobile phones and the Raspberry Pi. We will also explore different techniques to optimize your model for inference, such as quantization and pruning. We will go through the process of converting your model to a format that can be easily deployed and executed on a wide range of devices.

One important consideration when deploying your model is ensuring that it remains efficient and performant while running in inference mode. In order to achieve fast, efficient inference, we will also take a look at how to manage inference on multiple devices in parallel with PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel module.

Join us as we dive into the exciting, but often challenging world of inference for large language models in PyTorch. In the next section, we will begin by discussing the different deployment settings available to you. Let's get started!
# Chapter 10: Inference of Large Language Models

## The Mysterious Slowdown

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson had just finished fine-tuning their large language model to provide high-quality recommendations for their clients. It had taken weeks, but their hard work had paid off. However, when they tried to run inference on the newly fine-tuned model, things started to take an unexpected turn.

The model inference was very slow, and it was taking several seconds to provide responses to simple queries. This was a major issue, as they needed to generate responses in near real-time to provide actionable insights to their clients. There appeared to be no apparent issues with their PyTorch implementation. Something else must have been causing the slow inference.

## The Investigation Begins

Holmes and Watson examined the hardware they were using to perform inference with their model. They noticed that they were using a CPU-only deployment setup, which meant that they were not taking full advantage of the GPU resources available. They suspected that this was one of the factors contributing to the slow inference time.

They also decided to explore the use of model quantization and pruning to reduce the size of their model and improve inference speed. They spent many hours tweaking the model and trying different optimization techniques.

## The Resolution

After days of investigation and experimentation, they came up with a solution that allowed them to perform inference much faster. They discovered that using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel module to perform inference on multiple GPUs at the same time dramatically speed up inference time. After deploying their model on a GPU-equipped machine and taking full advantage of the available resources, they were able to reduce inference time by over 90%.

They also used model quantization and pruning to further improve performance, reducing the model size and optimizing the inference process. With these optimizations, they were able to achieve near-instant inference times, allowing them to provide their clients with actionable insights and high-quality recommendations in real-time.

The mystery of the slow inference had been solved, and Holmes and Watson had once again used their knowledge of PyTorch to overcome a technical challenge. They were pleased with their solution, and they knew that it would enable them to continue providing their clients with the best possible service.

## Resolving the Mystery with PyTorch Code

In order to resolve the slow inference mystery faced by Holmes and Watson, they had to use PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel module to parallelize the inference process. This would allow them to take full advantage of the many available GPUs on their deployment machine. Additionally, they used model quantization and pruning techniques to reduce the size of their model and improve inference speed.

To parallelize model inference with DistributedDataParallel module, you need to wrap your model with it and use a DistributedSampler for the dataloader:

```python
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp

def setup(rank, world_size):
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12355'
    # initialize the process group
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

def cleanup():
    dist.destroy_process_group()

def parallel_inference(model, dataset, num_workers, device):
    world_size = num_workers
    setup(rank, world_size)
    model = model.to(device)
    model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[rank])
    sampler = torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler(dataset, num_replicas=world_size, rank=rank)
    dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=False, num_workers=2, pin_memory=True, sampler=sampler)
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in dataloader:
            input_ids = batch['input_ids'].to(device)
            attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'].to(device)
            outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
            ...
    cleanup()
```

In this example, we wrap the model with the DistributedDataParallel module and use a DistributedSampler to split the data across multiple replicas. We have also used multi-processing to spawn multiple worker processes to parallelize the batch processing.

Additionally, model quantization and pruning can be used to further optimize model inference. With quantization, we can reduce the precision of the model parameters from 32-bit floating point to 16 or even 8-bit integers. This can significantly reduce the memory footprint and processing time needed to load and run the model.

```python
from torch.quantization import QuantStub, DeQuantStub, quantize_dynamic, fuse_modules

class FineTunedModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super(FineTunedModel, self).__init__()
        self.transformer = BertForSequenceClassification(config)
        self.quant = QuantStub()
        self.dequant = DeQuantStub()

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        input_ids = self.quant(input_ids)
        attention_mask = self.quant(attention_mask)
        outputs = self.transformer(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        logits = outputs[0]
        logits = self.dequant(logits)
        return logits

model = FineTunedModel(config)
model.eval()
quantized_model = quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)
```

In this example, we have used the PyTorch quantization package to quantize the FineTunedModel to 8-bit integers using quantize_dynamic method. This method quantizes only the specified modules of the model, limiting the impact on model performance. The resulting quantized model can be then used for faster inference, without significant loss in accuracy.

By using these techniques, Holmes and Watson were able to optimize their fine-tuned language model and achieve fast, efficient inference.
