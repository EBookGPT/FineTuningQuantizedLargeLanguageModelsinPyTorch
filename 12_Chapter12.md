# Chapter 12: Quantization-aware Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models

Welcome back dear reader! In the previous chapter, we delved into the world of optimization techniques for quantized models. Now that you have a good grasp of how to optimize quantized models in PyTorch, let's dive a little deeper and explore fine-tuning of large language models using quantization-aware methods.

Fine-tuning large language models has become a common practice in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Fine-tuning is a process where the model is trained on a specific task by utilizing pre-trained weights of a general-purpose language model. This process is particularly useful when dealing with limited data for a specific task, as the pre-trained model has already learned the basic language structures.

When deploying large models, one of the key challenges is their inference cost - the amount of time and computational power required to use the model for real-world tasks. This is where quantization comes into play. Quantization is a technique to reduce the precision of the weights and neural activations of a model, thereby reducing the model size and inference cost, while retaining similar accuracy.

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of quantization-aware fine-tuning in PyTorch. We will look at the various quantization-aware fine-tuning methods and techniques available, and evaluate their effectiveness on different NLP tasks. We will also touch on the benefits and limitations of these methods, and provide some real-world examples to help illustrate their practical applications.

So, fasten your seatbelts and join us on this quest as we master the art of quantization-aware fine-tuning of large language models!
# The Wizard of Oz: A Tale of Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning

Once upon a time, in the far-off land of PyTorchia, there lived a young practitioner named Dorothy. Dorothy had a burning desire to develop the most accurate and efficient natural language processing model in the land. She knew that her dreams could only be realized if she could fine-tune her large language model accurately and make it efficient for real-world applications.

One day, Dorothy decided to travel to the great Wizard of Oz for guidance on this challenging task. The Wizard of Oz was renowned for his wealth of knowledge on all things related to PyTorchia.

When Dorothy finally reached the Wizard's castle, she found him working on his latest experiment. "Oh great Wizard, I seek your guidance on fine-tuning my large language model using quantization-aware techniques," said Dorothy.

"Ahh, I see you have come seeking knowledge on the art of quantization-aware fine-tuning," replied the Wizard. "It is a tricky path to tread, but fear not, for I shall guide you!"

The Wizard went on to explain the various quantization techniques and tools that can be used in PyTorchia, and how to use them effectively to fine-tune large language models. He explained that the key to effective quantization-aware fine-tuning is choosing the correct approach that is appropriate for your specific use case.

Dorothy diligently followed the Wizard's teachings and applied them to her large language model. She used quantization-aware fine-tuning methods to make her model more efficient for inference, while still maintaining high accuracy.

After much hard work and dedication, Dorothy's model was finally ready for deployment. She tested her model on various real-world tasks and was pleasantly surprised by its accuracy and efficiency.

Dorothy was overjoyed with the results and returned to the Wizard to show him what she had accomplished. "Thank you, oh great Wizard, for teaching me the art of quantization-aware fine-tuning," she said. "With your guidance, I was able to develop a model that was both accurate and efficient for real-world applications."

The Wizard smiled and replied, "I knew you had it in you all along, young Dorothy. The power to succeed was within you. I simply showed you the way."

And thus, Dorothy lived happily ever after, with her accurate and efficient finely-tuned large language model by her side.

The end.
Surely! The code used to resolve the Wizard of Oz parable involves the implementation of the quantization-aware fine-tuning of large language models in PyTorch. 

In PyTorch, this is accomplished using the `torch.quantization` module, which provides various tools and functions for quantizing models. The `quantization-aware fine-tuning` approach enables us to fine-tune pre-trained models while considering the impact of quantization on the model's accuracy.

We can achieve this by using the `quantization-aware training` API that PyTorch provides. This approach involves the following steps:

1. Load the pre-trained model and prepare the dataset for fine-tuning.
2. Quantize the model using the `torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic` function.
3. Create a `QuantWrapper` module around our model, which can be used to account for the quantization schemes used in the previous step.
4. Train the quantized model with the `quantization-aware training` API.
5. Evaluate the fine-tuned model.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates this approach:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.quantization

# Load pre-trained model
model = torch.hub.load('pytorch/vision', 'resnet18', pretrained=True)

# Prepare dataset for fine-tuning
train_dataset = ...
test_dataset = ...

# Quantize model
model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, {torch.nn.Conv2d}, dtype=torch.qint8
)

# Create QuantWrapper module
class QuantWrapper(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model):
        super(QuantWrapper, self).__init__()
        self.quant = torch.quantization.QuantStub()
        self.dequant = torch.quantization.DeQuantStub()
        self.model = model
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.quant(x)
        x = self.model(x)
        x = self.dequant(x)
        return x

quant_model = QuantWrapper(model)

# Define loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(quant_model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

# Train the model using the quantization-aware training API
quant_model.train()

# Iterate over the dataset and fine-tune the model
for data, target in train_dataset:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = quant_model(data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Evaluate the fine-tuned model
quant_model.eval()

# Iterate over the test dataset and evaluate the model
with torch.no_grad():
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    for data, target in test_dataset:
        output = quant_model(data)
        _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)
        total += target.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == target).sum().item()

print('Accuracy: %d %%' % (100 * correct / total))
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `quantization-aware training` API to fine-tune a pre-trained model using quantization-aware techniques. By following these steps, we can effectively fine-tune our models while considering the impact of quantization on our model's accuracy and efficiency.
