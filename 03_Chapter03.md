# Chapter 3: Pre-training Neural Language Models 

In the previous chapter, we learned about the significance of Large Language Models and their importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Now we will delve deeper into the pre-training process of Neural Language Models, which is a crucial step in creating effective NLP models.

It is essential to understand pre-training of Neural Language Models as it helps us develop better language models with higher accuracy and better generalization abilities. Pre-training is a process of training models using large amounts of varied and unlabeled data before fine-tuning them on a specific NLP task. With pre-training, we can leverage unsupervised learning techniques to learn the essential linguistic features that can be used in downstream tasks.

In recent years, pre-training techniques such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) have revolutionized the field of NLP. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks, including language translation, reading comprehension, and sentiment analysis.

In this chapter, we will cover the pre-training process and techniques used in large language models. We will gain a better understanding of BERT and GPT and their architecture. Finally, we will gain hands-on experience by developing our own pre-trained Neural Language Model in PyTorch.

So, buckle up and get ready for an exciting journey to learn the techniques of pre-training Neural Language Models to develop powerful NLP models.
# Chapter 3: Pre-training Neural Language Models 

## Robin Hood and the Pre-Trained NLP Model

Robin Hood was known for his extraordinary archery skills, but he was also an avid reader and always wanted to improve his vocabulary. One day, as he was reading a book, he realized that he could use his archery skills to create a system that could help him learn new words.

He set out to build a system that could generate sentences using unfamiliar vocabulary, and he knew that pre-training neural language models could be the key to making it work.

Using the pre-training process, Robin trained his model on a large corpus of text, allowing it to extract essential linguistic features from the text. After the model was pre-trained, Robin was able to fine-tune the model on language tasks such as sentence completion and word prediction. With each task, the model learned new vocabulary and became more accurate in generating sentences.

Robin realized that pre-training techniques such as BERT and GPT had transformed the field of NLP and had enabled the creation of powerful models that could perform multiple language tasks with high accuracy.

With his newfound knowledge of pre-training neural language models, Robin started teaching kids in his village, helping them increase their vocabulary and improve their reading skills.

In this chapter, we learned about the pre-training process and techniques used in large language models. We also gained a better understanding of BERT and GPT and their architecture. Finally, we gained hands-on experience by developing our own pre-trained Neural Language Model in PyTorch.

With this knowledge, we can now follow in Robin Hood's footsteps and develop powerful NLP models that can help us understand and communicate with each other more effectively.
## Code Explanation

To resolve the Robin Hood story, we can use PyTorch to develop our own pre-trained Neural Language Model. Here is a brief explanation of the steps involved:

### 1. Tokenization

The first step in creating a Neural Language Model is to tokenize the text into its constituent words, so that it can be processed by the model. We use the `BertTokenizer` class from the `transformers` library to tokenize the text.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', do_lower_case=True)

text = "Robin Hood was known for his extraordinary archery skills, but he was also an avid reader and always wanted to improve his vocabulary."

tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

print(tokenized_text)
```

### 2. Encoding

The next step is to convert the tokenized text into numerical representations that can be fed into the Neural Language Model. We use the `BertModel` class from the `transformers` library to encode the tokenized text.

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertModel

model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

input_ids = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode(text, add_special_tokens=True)])
hidden_states, pooler_output = model(input_ids)
```

### 3. Pre-Training

Now we can begin the pre-training process by training the model on a large corpus of text. We use the `Trainer` class from the `transformers` library to pre-train the model.

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # output directory
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,              # total number of training epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,  # batch size per device during training
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                   # the instantiated Transformers model to be trained
    args=training_args,            # training arguments, defined above
    train_dataset=dataset         # training dataset
)

trainer.train()
```

### 4. Fine-Tuning

After pre-training, we can fine-tune the model on language tasks such as sentence completion and word prediction. We use the `Trainer` class again to fine-tune the model.

```python
fine_tune_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # output directory
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=5,              # total number of training epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,  # batch size per device during training
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                   # the instantiated Transformers model to be trained
    args=fine_tune_args,           # fine-tuning arguments, defined above
    train_dataset=dataset         # fine-tuning dataset
)

trainer.train()
```

By following these steps, we can develop our own pre-trained Neural Language Model in PyTorch and apply it to various language tasks just like Robin Hood did.
